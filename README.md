### üìö How to use

#### 1. Pull an image, such as version v0.2.0-alpha.

```bash
$ docker pull fishgoddess/postar:v0.2.0-alpha
```

#### 2. Run this image by two ways.

* By Docker

_Before running this image, you should prepare a config file named "postar.ini", and a typical config file will be like
this:_

```ini
[logger]
output_file = "/tmp/postar.log"
error_output_file = "/tmp/postar.error.log"

[sender]
smtp_host = "smtp.xxx.com"
smtp_port = 587
smtp_user = "xxx@xxx.com"
smtp_password = "xxx"
```

_You should replace the information of yours._

_Then, it's ok! Try to run by this command, and you will see some logs printed on screen:_

```bash
$ docker run --name postar -p 5897:5897 -v /etc/postar/postar.ini:/opt/postar-v0.2.0-alpha/conf/postar.ini -d fishgoddess/postar:v0.2.0-alpha
```

_Remember "/etc/postar/postar.ini" is where your config file is._

_The work directory is "/opt/postar-v0.2.0-alpha"._

_If you want to enter the container, try this:_

```bash
$ docker exec -it postar sh
```

_Notice that the based image we used is alpine, which doesn't have bash._

_So, you should use sh instead of bash._

* By Docker-compose

_First, a config file is needed too, just like mentioned above._

_Second, you should prepare a file named "docker-compose.yaml", and a typical docker-compose file will be like this:_

```yaml
version: "3.1"

services:
  postar:
    image: fishgoddess/postar:v0.2.0-alpha
    ports:
      - "5897:5897"
    volumes:
      - ./log:/opt/postar-v0.2.0-alpha/log
      - ./conf/postar.ini:/opt/postar-v0.2.0-alpha/postar.ini
```

_Notice that we map directory "logs" in the container to local directory "logs"._

_So, you can read these logs conveniently._

_Then, you can execute docker-compose command to run it:_

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### 3. Enjoy it!
